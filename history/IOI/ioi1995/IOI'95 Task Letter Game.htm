letters and its value </CENTER>
<P>Letter games are popular at home and on television. In one version of the 
game, every letter has a value, and you collect letters to form one or more 
words giving the highest possible score. Unless you have `a way with words', you 
will try all the words you know, sometimes looking up the spelling, and then 
compute the scores. Obviously, this can be done more accurately by computer. 
<P>Given the values in Figure&nbsp;1, a list of English words, and the letters 
collected: find the highest scoring words or pairs of words that can be formed. 
<H2>Input Data</H2>The input file <TT>INPUT.TXT</TT> contains one line with a 
string of lowercase letters (from `<TT>a</TT>' to `<TT>z</TT>'): the letters 
collected. The string consists of at least&nbsp;3 and at most 7 letters in 
arbitrary order. 
<P>The `dictionary' file <TT>WORDS.TXT</TT> consists of at most 40,000 lines. At 
the end of this file is a line with a single period (`<TT>.</TT>'). Each of the 
other lines contains a string of at least&nbsp;3 and at most&nbsp;7 lowercase 
letters. The file <TT>WORDS.TXT</TT> is sorted alphabetically and contains no 
duplicates. 
<H2>Output Data</H2>On the first line of file <TT>OUTPUT.TXT</TT>, your program 
should write the highest score (Subtask&nbsp;A), and on each of the following 
lines, all the words and/or word pairs from file <TT>WORDS.TXT</TT> with this 
score (Subtask&nbsp;B). A letter must not occur more often in an output line 
than in the input line. Use the letter values given in Figure&nbsp;1. 
<P>When a combination of two words can be formed with the given letters, the 
words should be printed on the same line separated by a space. Do not duplicate 
pairs; for example, `<TT>rag prom</TT>' and `<TT>prom rag</TT>' are the same 
pair, therefore only one of them should be written. A pair in an output line may 
consist of two identical words. 
<H2>Example Input and Output</H2>Figure&nbsp;2 gives example input and output.
