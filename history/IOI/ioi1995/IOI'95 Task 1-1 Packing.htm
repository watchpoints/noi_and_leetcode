<BR>Figure 1: The six basic layouts of four rectangles </CENTER>
<P>Four rectangles are given. Find the smallest enclosing (new) rectangle into 
which these four may be fitted without overlapping. By smallest rectangle we 
mean the one with the smallest area. 
<P>All four rectangles should have their sides parallel to the corresponding 
sides of the enclosing rectangle. Figure 1 shows six ways to fit four rectangles 
together. These six are the only possible basic layouts, since any other layout 
can be obtained from a basic layout by rotation or reflection. 
<P>There may exist several different enclosing rectangles fulfilling the 
requirements, all with the same area. You have to produce <I>all</I> such 
enclosing rectangles. 
<P>
<H2>Input Data</H2>The input file <TT>INPUT.TXT</TT> consists of four lines. 
Each line describes one given rectangle by two positive integers: the lengths of 
the sides of the rectangle. Each side of a rectangle is at least 1 and at most 
50. 
<H2>Output Data</H2>The output file <TT>OUTPUT.TXT</TT> should contain one line 
more than the number of solutions. The first line contains a single integer: the 
minimum area of the enclosing rectangles (Subtask A). Each of the following 
lines contains one solution described by two numbers <I>p</I> and <I>q</I> with 
<I>p</I>&lt;=<I>q</I> (Subtask B). These lines must be sorted in ascending order 
of <I>p</I>, and must all be different. 
<H2>Example Input and Output</H2>Figure 2 gives example input and output files.
